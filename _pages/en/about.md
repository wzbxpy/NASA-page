<h2 class="section-title" style="display: none;">🌍 Lab Introduction</h2>

#### Research Areas and Directions

- **Computer Networks** (Data Center Networks, Wide Area Networks, Programmable Networks)
  - _Key Members: Zheng Jiaqi, Meng Qingkai, Huang Chengyuan, Cao Peirui_
- **Distributed Systems** (Large Model ML System Acceleration, Cloud-Native Systems)
  - _Key Members: Wang Xiaoliang, Gu Rong, Wang Qing, Xie Minhui_
- **Emerging Computing** (Quantum Networks and Transmission, Graph Computing, Vector Databases)
  - _Key Members: Zhao Yangming, Huan Chengying, Wang Zhibin_

#### Why Choose Us & Collaboration Advantages

1.  **Top-tier Faculty:** The team consists of 11 faculty members, including 2 NSFC Distinguished Young Scholars, 1 MOE Young Yangtze River Scholar, and 1 NSFC Excellent Young Scholar, representing top-tier academic strength.
2.  **Top-tier Students:** PhD student selection ratio reaches 40:1, mostly top-tier students from C9 universities. Graduate students regularly win Best Paper or Distinguished Paper awards at top international conferences.
3.  **Top-tier Impact:** Leading globally in paper publications at top computer systems conferences such as EuroSys and ASPLOS.
4.  **Core Advantages:** The team has deep expertise in networks and distributed systems, backed by the State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, with extensive industry-academia collaboration experience and proven talent cultivation track record.

#### Key Achievements

- **Congestion Management Protocol Stack:** Pyrrha and PrioPlus were accepted by **NSDI 2025** and **EuroSys 2025** respectively. Pyrrha is the **first** internationally to propose a flow-control-centric congestion management protocol architecture.
- **Network Digital Twin:** μMon and Unison were published in **SIGCOMM 2024** and **EuroSys 2024**, with Marlin accepted by **EuroSys 2025**. μMon is the world's first microsecond-granularity per-flow telemetry system; Marlin is a programmable high-throughput high-precision network tester addressing critical technology bottlenecks.
- **Programmable Devices:** P4RTC was accepted by **NSDI 2025**, building a programmable network ecosystem based on domestic (Huawei) programmable routers, challenging the monopoly of the US Tofino platform.
- **Large Model System Optimization:** Hermes system and componentized Roofline model were published in **ATC 2025** and **ASPLOS 2025**. This work targets Ascend chips, achieving high-precision performance bottleneck diagnosis and optimization for the first time, providing critical support for unleashing domestic AI computing power. Fine-grained energy optimization work published in **ASPLOS 2025** achieved millisecond-level energy optimization with 15.27% AICore energy reduction, supporting low-carbon green computing.
- **Graph Computing:** Subgraph matching and community detection algorithms were published in **SIGMOD 2023, ATC 2023, PPoPP 2025**, successfully applied to the domestic graph database GraphScope. Temporal graph detection algorithms were published in **ICDE 2022** and **EuroSys 2023 / 2025**, applied to the domestic graph database TuGraph, comprehensively supporting graph computing technology deployment on domestic platforms.
