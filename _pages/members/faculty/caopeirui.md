I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University (NJU). Before that, I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2024, master degree from Beihang University in March 2018 and bachelor degree from Southeast University in June 2015. I am very grateful for learning so much from my PhD advisor, Shizhen Zhao. Besides, I was a Research and Development Engineer (special offer winner) in Baidu's search infrastructure team from April 2018 to May 2019.
