I am an assistant researcher in School of Intelligent Software and Engineering, Nanjing University. I am also a member of NASA and COSEC. I received my Ph.D. degree in School of Computer Science, Nanjing University, advised by Prof. Chen Tian and Prof. Sheng Zhong. I have been interning at GraphScope team in Alibaba DAMO Academy from 2021 to 2024, supervised by Longbin Lai. My research interests include accelerating subgraph matching and other graph algorithms using new hardware, especially GPUs. Recently, I am engaged in accelerating LLM inference.
